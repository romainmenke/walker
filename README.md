# walker
GPX file modifier utility

### Steps :

 - Download this repo
 - Open the Xcode project
 - Run the empty app on your device
 - `Debug` menu -> `Simulate Location` -> `current` (you need to do this each time, else the Apple script doesn't work)
 - Open `updateXcodeLocSim` and run it. It will complain about settings, adjust them.
 - Open `walker`, a new terminal window will appear and now you can move arround with the WASD keys.
 
### Optional Steps :

 - Connect a controller (PS3 bindings are also in the repo)
 - Move arround with the arrow keys
