# walker
GPX file modifier utility

### Steps :

 - Download this repo
 - Open the Xcode project
 - Set the `lon` and `lat` found in `current.gpx` to a location of your choosing.
 - Run the empty app on your device
 - `Debug` menu -> `Simulate Location` -> `current` (you need to do this each time, else the Apple script doesn't work)
 - Open `updateXcodeLocSim` and run it. It will complain about settings, adjust them. (you only need to do this once)
 - Open `walker`, a new terminal window will appear and now you can move arround with the `WASD` keys.
 - Press `q` to exit.

### Optional Steps :

 - Download Enjoyable : https://yukkurigames.com/enjoyable/
 - Connect a controller (PS3 bindings are also in the repo)
 - Move arround with the arrow keys

### Controls :

 - `w` -> Move forwards
 - `a` -> Turn left
 - `d` -> Turn right
 - `s` -> Turn arround
 - `q` -> exit

### Disclaimer :

This is a serious tool for testing mapping applications, don't use it to cheat in games like Pokemon GO.
Spoofing your location on iOS devices should only be used for testing. ;-) 
Don't play Pokemon Go from your couch.
